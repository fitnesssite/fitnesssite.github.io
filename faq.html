			<h3>Which is more important: diet or exercise?</h3>
			<p>Which is more important: diet or exercise?</p>
			<p>Both are equally important! The ratio of diet to exercise is 70/30. 70% of your efforts to lose or gain weight is your nutrition and 30% is exercise. This ratio has been shown to be the most effective as far as seeing results. Diet and exercise work together hand-in-hand, and one will not be as effective without the other. </p>

			<h3>Will over-the-counter weight loss supplements help me lose weight faster?</h3>
			<p>Will over-the-counter weight loss supplements help me lose weight faster?</p>
			<p>Diet pills rarely lead to permanent weight loss. The best method for weight loss is the tried-and-true formula of good eating habits and plenty of exercise. Using over-the-counter weight loss drugs is a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Save the money and spend it on nutritious foods. Get in touch with your hunger and appetite instead of relying on supplements that are uncontrolled by the FDA and often have no scientific proof of effectiveness.
			Experts agree: The best way to lose weight is to get regular physical activity and eat meals made up of foods that satisfy hunger and control appetite. Include a source of lean or low fat protein at all meals and snacks along with high-fiber fruit, vegetables, or whole grains for the most satiating meals.</p>

			<h3>How much weight do I need to lose to gain health benefits?</h3>
			<p>How much weight do I need to lose to gain health benefits?</p>
			<p>Small amounts of weight loss is achieved in a healthful manner is most beneficial. Losing as little as 5% of body weight can help improve blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and blood triglycerides. Being overweight increases the risk for many chronic diseases, and losing small amounts of weight can improve your health and slowly help you reach a healthier weight. We encourage you to make small changes in eating and physical activity patterns that can be sustained over time and which will slowly help you lose weight permanently. Consistency is key.</p>

			<h3>What types of food should I eat before exercising? </h3>
			<p>What types of food should I eat before exercising? </p>
			<p>Carbohydrates and protein are always a good source of energy before
 exercising. Carbs help maintain your blood-glucose (blood sugar) levels and protein helps keep your muscles well-fed during your workout. You should also try to consume a generous amount of fluid before any physical activity to keep your body hydrated.

			<h3>What are some things that I can measure to see if I'm making any improvements?</h3>
			<p>What are some things that I can measure to see if I'm making any improvements?</p>
			<p>You could keep track of your:</p>
				<p><b>Resting heart rate (RHR)</b>: a stronger, more efficient heart will have a lower RHR.</p>
				<p><b>Body measurements</b>: measure your hips, waist, thighs and calves (and anything else you may want to keep track of). If you need to lose body fat, these measurements will decrease gradually as you lose fat. Bear in mind that at the same time, hopefully, you are gaining muscle.</p>
				<p><b>Rate of Perceived Exertion</b>: as you become more fit, your RPE for a specific exercise may change. For example, if you've been sedentary and start a program of walking for a month, your RPE will most likely be lower for the walk on your first day of the program compared to the walk on your last day for the same distance and pace.</p>
				<p><b>Clothes, jewelry</b>: if you are trying to lose body fat, you may notice looseness in your clothing or in jewelry such as rings or watches.</p>
				<p><b>Weight</b>: Anecdotally, this seems to be the last thing to rely on. You may only notice a decrease in weight after seeing other improvements in your body.</p>
